# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    - It was difficult at first, I got stuck on how to incorporate methods into the class. After a lot of experimenting, google searching, and reading. I figured it out. I was very frustrated, but figuring it out was extremely satisfying. I think I need a lot more practice, but it is starting to click in my brain. 
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    - Pretty good today, I made myself set timers and follow through with taking breaks. I left the room, went outside, etc. and I believe that it helped a lot. 
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    - The order of everything matters...a lot. My biggest mistakes tended to involve where something was supposed to be placed. I also need to make sure that I'm very careful with every character. I've got to slow down sometimes!
